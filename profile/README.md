 At Taebi Lab, we are committed to developing cutting-edge sensing systems and computational methods for non-invasive diagnosis and personalized treatment of **cardiovascular diseases**, with a focus on **health equity**. These medical conditions continue to claim lives at an alarming rate, with one death every 34 seconds in the United States alone. Developing personalized treatments to replace the current traditional one-size-fits-all approaches will enhance treatment effectiveness. Provided that effective treatments are available; with timely diagnoses facilitated by our innovative methods, patients will receive earlier referrals to medical teams, leading to improved outcomes and a higher quality of life. Our research primarily centers on the **analysis of body vibrations**, with the aim of transforming our solutions into powerful bedside or cost-effective home monitoring tools through close collaboration with clinical and industrial partners. Our ultimate goal is to reduce mortality rates, optimize medical therapy, reduce hospital stays, and improve the lives of patients affected by cardiovascular diseases.
